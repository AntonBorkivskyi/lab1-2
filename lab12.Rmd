E(X) = 1 ?? P(X = 1) + 0 ?? P(X = 0) = P(X = 1)

Strong Law of Large Numbers:

X_1 + X_2 + ... + X_n  a.e.
---------------------  --->  ??
           n
                                                                      _          
Sample mean value converges almost everywhere to expected value of X: X -> E(X)

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
